# gliffy-icons-for-yed

Icons with a "gliffy" look for yED. Based on work done by Andrew J Lee (available [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/1576472-Network-Diagram-Icons/attachments/242689)).

The `.graphml` just has to be imported as a new palette in yED through `Edit` > `Manage Palette` > `Import Section`
